## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Carousel Patterns]
**Learning:** Auto-playing carousels require explicit user control (pause on hover/focus) and semantic ARIA roles (region, group, tablist) to be accessible and compliant with W3C standards.
**Action:** Always implement pause-on-hover/focus for any auto-playing UI elements and use `aria-roledescription="carousel"` and `aria-roledescription="slide"` for screen reader clarity.
