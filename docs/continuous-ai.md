# Continuous AI

Exploring LLM-powered automation in platform-based software collaboration.

## What is it for?

Continuous AI is about applying AI-enriched automation to software collaboration in ways that become as seamless, multi-faceted, and ubiquitous as CI/CD.

## What is Continuous AI?

Continuous AI is a label for all uses of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform.

The term aligns with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

- CI/CD automates integration and deployment.
- Continuous AI automates and enhances collaboration workflows.

Continuous AI is not a single product. It is an open category of activities, workloads, recipes, technologies, and capabilities.

## Example Continuous AI workloads

- **Continuous Documentation**: Continuously populate and improve documentation.
- **Continuous Code Improvement**: Improve comments, tests, and related code quality artifacts.
- **Continuous Triage**: Label, summarize, and respond to issues in natural language.
- **Continuous Summarization**: Keep project and change summaries up to date.
- **Continuous Fault Analysis**: Explain failed CI runs with contextual insights.
- **Continuous Quality**: Analyze code quality and suggest standards-aligned improvements.
- **Continuous Team Motivation**: Transform team activity into motivational artifacts and nudges.
- **Continuous Accessibility**: Check and improve accessibility in code and docs.

## Common characteristics

Continuous AI tasks are usually:

- **Automatable**
- **Repetitive**
- **Collaborative**
- **Integrated into existing platforms/workflows**
- **Auditable**
- **Variant-rich across teams and domains**
- **Event-triggered**

## Collaboration over individual productivity

Continuous AI focuses on team-level outcomes in software collaboration, not only individual productivity. It emphasizes controlled, auditable automation that supports collective quality, process health, and delivery outcomes.

## Continuous AI on GitHub

At GitHub, Continuous AI can be explored through combinations of:

- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Models
- LLM frameworks like GenAIScript, `llm`, and `ell`

These allow teams to build event-driven workflows for documentation, issue triage, summarization, and code quality tasks.

## Relationship to agents

Continuous AI may include fully autonomous agents, but often centers on scripted, "agent-like" workflows with human oversight and tight scope boundaries.

## Current project direction (GitHub Next framing)

The Continuous AI initiative emphasizes:

1. Introducing and clarifying the term.
2. Grounding it with examples and patterns.
3. Demonstrating what is possible on GitHub today.
4. Identifying platform capabilities and opportunities.
5. Exploring GitHub as a home for software agents.
6. Connecting with open-source Continuous AI technologies.
7. Aligning ecosystem tooling with GitHub Models and Actions.
8. Investigating medium/long-horizon manifestations.

## Try it today

A practical way to experiment is by creating GitHub Actions workflows that call `actions/ai-inference` and integrating model-enabled tasks into repository automation.
